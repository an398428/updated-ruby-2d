1.)	I had some struggles with the code but was either able to figure it out or ask Daelyn for 
	help with completing it such as some portions of the Restart code. I was able to complete
	the particle effects for health up and health down with no issues and got most of the way 
	through step 4 to create the Restart UI element and some portions of that code.
	
	i.	All assets I used were found in the game folders already ðŸ˜Š

1.	I had already impelemted a bool pool button for the switching of the Robots to go from
		Horizontal progression to Vertical, so that part was pretty easy! There was no issue 
		there.
	The smoke particle effect on the Robots gave me some trouble and I want to switch the 
		way it is getting the game object, but so far when I do that it stops only one of the 
		particle emitters from working. So... we just did a get component instead because it
		was a lot easier even if it does not allow for a whole lot of fun effects right now.
		It was a lot of trial and error for me on that side as I could get it to start, but
		the stopping it wanted to fight me the entire time. I danced along with my robots
		when it worked. I also changed the fog effect to change colour over time to give 
		more vairety to how the smoke is displayed compared to the vent smoke. 
2.	I extended the bounds of the game to add more area to the park to include some more 
		ponds and water features while also making a larger "Danger" area. I have a second
		one planned if I have to extend the bounds once more. Again simple thing to fix as
		I have planned bounds on my tiles already. I also have stones with planned bounds
		in case I want to make a world borders of a different sort.
		
	i. All Assets were already withen the folders! We each created our own folder of 
		where we stored our work!
